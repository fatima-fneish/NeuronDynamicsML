# NeuronDynamicsML
Modeling neuronal voltage dynamics using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics.
# NeuronDynamics-PINN-SINDy

This repository contains the Colab notebooks and documentation for the project:
**"Data-Driven and Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Chaotic Neuronal Dynamics"**.

We apply **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and **Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)** to learn interpretable biophysical models from intracellular voltage recordings of zebra finch neurons.
